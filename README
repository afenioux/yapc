Hello, thank you to check out this projet,
I hope you will enjoy it, this is was my first try in php,
I wrote it severals years ago, but
I m always seeking for reviews and advises!

The "bad" thing is, the admin interface is in French!

you can test it with user foo pass bar (http://yapc/admin)

Yapc is as simple CMS written in php,

features are :
*write new articles
*create categories to sort your articles
*edit/delete categories/articles
*upload photos
*add/remove users able to post articles

some screenshots in the screenshots folder.

Install notes :
*use create_database.sql to create the mysql tables
*set you mysql host/login/pass in inc/db_fns.php (line 4+)
*edit the admin/inc/header_new_article.php admin/inc/header.php inc/header.php
*copy paste into you web directory and you are done!

Arnaud
